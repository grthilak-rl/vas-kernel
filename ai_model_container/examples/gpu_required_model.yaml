# GPU-Required Model - Example of Strict GPU Requirement
# Phase 4.2.3 Model Configuration Template

# REQUIRED: Model Identity
model_id: yolov8x_gpu_only
model_name: YOLOv8 Extra-Large (GPU Only)
model_version: 8.0.0

# OPTIONAL: Metadata
description: Large-scale object detection model that REQUIRES GPU for acceptable performance

# REQUIRED: Supported Tasks
supported_tasks:
  - object_detection

# REQUIRED: Input Format
input_format: NV12

# REQUIRED: Expected Resolution
expected_resolution: [1280, 1280]

# REQUIRED: Resource Requirements
